    <p>Dear Nabiha,</p>

    <p>This letter is for you, for my love, my partner, my personal psychologist.</p>

    <p>It's time that we realize that I am unfunctionable without you, but how so....</p>

    <p>Let's take a step back in time, 3 years ago, yes. I was an independent young journalist + pre-youtuber, <br> and then I stumbled across you during my peak timing of success. But why so? How so? Is it fate? Reality?</p>

    <p>My love, I will tell you one thing, the moment we started getting close, is the moment that we were slowly <br> realizing that we are falling into a trap, a trap of not love, but understanding, because, honestly, I was amazed by the similarity and distinct quality of your personality that helped me become a better person.</p>

    <p>Nevertheless, I was also very much happy with the way you looked and talked too. As a person, I was finding the smallest things <br> lead to the most invaluable feeling, the feeling of relatedness, happiness, and peace. When I see you, used to see you, I saw peace, and that's why I want to carry on with the peace.</p>

    <p>With my move to Canada, things have changed a lot since then, it allowed both of us to grow at a very high-paced state, and that's why I believe everything happens for a good reason.</p>

    <p>2 months in, and now I am in Canada, how hard things were, right? Every night there used to be a time where my heart was terribly trembling by your absence, the same for you... How does time, struggle change so fast but the love, care, the vitamin D, the plans, the books, the research, the talks, the calls, stay the same?</p>

    <p>You see, my honey, 2 days ago, I was crying in my university with a mumbling face saying "Ami amr bou ke kichu dite parlam na", and then here you are, trying to console me on every lateral confusion that I have.</p>

    <p>After all, you are my wife, Shahriyar Mahir's wife and personal psychologist, and I hope this letter convinces you to stay beside me as my doctor, till death or fate pulls us apart.</p>

    <p>Sincerely,</p>
    <p>Shahriyar Mahir, your client + guide + business supporter + partner + best friend</p>

    <p>Happy Anniversary Once Again, with empty hands but software skills</p>
